# Moodle-Auto-Course-Progression
The autounitprog plugin automatically enrolls users to the next unit in the list when the student complete the current unit. The unit completion feature is what states if a unit is complete by a student or not. The list of units must be defined in the settings with units separated by coma (eg:unit01,unit02,unit03). Each line should define only a single unit sequence and each sequence should start with a unique unit.
