# Moodle-Auto-Course-Progression
The autounitprog plugin automatically enrolls users to the next unit in the list when the student complete the current unit. The submission of the last assessment is the trigger for enrolling student into the next unit in the list. The list of units must be defined in the settings with units separated by coma (eg:unit01,unit02,unit03). Each line should define only a single unit sequence and each sequence should start with a unique unit.
